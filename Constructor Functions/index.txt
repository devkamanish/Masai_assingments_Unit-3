How to create objects 

Object Literals
Factory functions
Constructor functions (Which implicitly creates and return an object using this keyword).
Class constructor 


Static methods -> These methods are only available for the constructor function not for its instances.


-> When we create a non-primitive datatype it is created in different references even if the values of two objects are same but where they are stored is not same.
 But in case of class constructors whenever the methods are created  it is directly created in prototype and that same prototype is shared to all the instances.
