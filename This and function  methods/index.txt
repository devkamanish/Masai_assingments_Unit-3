  In JavaScript, the call() method is a powerful tool used to invoke
   a function with a specified this value and arguments provided individuall

   And apply() is also same as call() but it takes arguments as in the form of array.

   And bind()-> It does not invoke function immediately it creates a new function that always uses the specified this.
